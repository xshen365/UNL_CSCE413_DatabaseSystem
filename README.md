# How to run in MLPQ


This is done by using MLPQ system and loading in our <Unemployment Under Pandemic.txt> file. Run queries through the MLPQ system’s query function by typing in specified requirements, such as if you want to find the average unemployment rate you do: 


VIEW NAME  Average_Unemployment 
SELECT        u.Month, AVG(u.Rate) 
FROM           Unemployment AS u 
GROUP BY   u.Month.


The queries used in our presentation and corresponding results are shown in the recorded video.
